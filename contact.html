      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <a href="#content-1" class="accordion-toggle">How long does the adoption process take?</a>
        <div class="accordion-content" id="content-1">
          The adoption process can take minutes, more than an hour or even longer. It all depends on the type of organization and the adoption policies of that organization.

      <a href="#content-2" class="accordion-toggle">I’ve found a pet I’m interested in. Now what?</a>
        <div class="accordion-content" id="content-2">
          Congratulations! Your next step is to contact the organization listed on the pet’s page on our site or on Petfinder. If the pet is with a rescue group, you’ll probably be asked to email or phone, or even fill out a preliminary application.

If the pet is with a “brick and mortar” shelter, you’ll probably need to go to the shelter during its open hours and ask to see the pet in person.

        <a href="#content-3" class="accordion-toggle">What are the pros and cons of adopting from a rescue group?</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" id="content-3">
            Rescue group adoptions tend to be much more personalized. The foster families know the pets very well – they should, since they live with them! – and so they can give you a lot more information about how the pet fits into a family or home than shelters usually can.
This personalization often makes the adoption process more rigorous, and it can take a lot longer. The rescue group may want to conduct a home visit before finalizing the adoption, and will probably contact your veterinarian and references, too.

        <a href="#content-4" class="accordion-toggle">How much will it cost?</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" id="content-4">
            Sometimes pets are free if there’s a special promotion going on, but adoption fees commonly range between $25 and $250. But now and then the cost may be much higher. If you feel the cost is too high, ask what it’s based on. Was the pet with a rescue group that receives no outside funding, and pays for all veterinary care, spay/neuter, training, housing, etc. out of their own pockets? Did the pet have extraordinary expenses, such as costly medical care, before being made available for adoption?
